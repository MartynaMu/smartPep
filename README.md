## Faster Peptidomic Data Processing and Analysis

This is a package that derived from a necessity of functions to increase
the speed of processing peptidomic data pipeline for personal usage in
day-to-day work and which were missing in already available packages due
to specific data template.

Functions help process and retrieve important features from collected
data to develop a fast pipeline and conclusion bringing.

The future plan is to make the package more approachable and next submit
it to Bioconductor.
